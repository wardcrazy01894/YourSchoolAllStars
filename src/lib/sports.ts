// Sports registry.
//
// A school can field more than one sport. Each sport shares the school → sport →
// mode → game flow, but the playable engine (positions, roster size, eras,
// dataset) is sport-specific. Both basketball and football are live (#7); the
// per-sport `available` flag stays so a future sport can be scaffolded behind a
// "coming soon" screen rather than shipping a half-built draft. Whether a given
// SCHOOL can actually play a live sport still depends on it carrying that
// dataset — a data-less school degrades to the empty-wheel "no data yet" landing.
//
// Which sports a given SCHOOL offers is a separate question (a school may not
// field football at all — see `School.hasFootball`); `sportsForSchool` combines
// the two so the picker shows football only where it actually exists.
